# About Us

_Collectors of loved and unloved cookbooks_

The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain cookbooks

We adopt cookbooks that are looking for a new home because the maintainer has moved on from using Chef or does not want the burden of maintaining it themselves anymore
